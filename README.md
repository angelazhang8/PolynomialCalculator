## _Product Description:_
Function Wizard is an application that helps users explore the different properties of a polynomial. The application has two main features. The first feature of the application allows users to enter two different polynomials into text boxes in the user interface. The user can then add, subtract, multiply or divide the two polynomials. The second feature is a polynomial grapher that allows the user to graph any polynomial of their choice. The graphing feature creates a separate window where the graph of the function will be displayed. From the graph of the function, the user will be able to determine the roots, end behaviours and maximums and minimums of the function, along with the general shape of the function. 

## _Marketing Description:_
Is your math homework getting you down? Are you stressed about your next math test? If so, you should buy FunctionWizard© . FunctionWizard is the all in one Polynomial calculator that will help you double check all of your math solutions! FunctionWizard© can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and also find the exact and approximate roots of any polynomial! All you have to do is enter in the polynomials of your choice and choose which operation you would like to apply to the polynomials. With the click of a button, our application calculates the answer and immediately displays it to the screen. This will save you time and frustration, as it will allow you to easily double check your work. In addition, our calculator can also graph any function of your choice! Simply enter the polynomial you would like to graph and hit the graph button. Our program will create a simple sketch of the function, that will allow you to determine the general characteristics of the function. Think of the long hours you spent, the never-ending equations with 20+ terms you need to simplify, the tear-drenched pages, the frustration at the fact that you forgot an exponent somewhere, and you will start to realize the immense value of this software product. For all of your function needs, use FunctionWizard. 

## _Feature Description:_
### Polynomial Calculator:
	The Polynomial Calculator allows the user to input two different polynomials of any degree into separate text boxes. The user can then choose which operation they would like to conduct with the two polynomials. The program will perform the calculation and print the result to the screen so that the user can double check their own work. 

### Polynomial Grapher
	The polynomial grapher allows users to graph any polynomial they choose. The user can enter the polynomial in the user interface and then click the “Graph Polynomial” Button. The program produces a sketch of the function in a separate window. From the graph, the user will be able to determine the x and y-intercepts, the end behaviours, the local maximums and minimums, and also the general shape of the function. 

### Roots Finder
	The roots finder feature allows the user to enter any polynomial, and calculate the exact, and also the approximate roots of the function. The roots finder can approximate the roots within two decimals of accuracy.

# FunctionWizard © User Manual


## Polynomial Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division:
The FunctionWizard user interface allows you to enter polynomials of your choice and either multiply, subtract, add, or divide the polynomials. At the top of the window, you will find two text boxes where you can input the first and second polynomial. Polynomials should be entered by entering each term in this form: “4x^2+2x-7”. The leading coefficient of the term is entered first, then the letter x, then the carat symbol and then finally the exponent. Terms should be entered with no blank spaces in between the “+” or “-” signs in order of descending exponents. In between the two textboxes is a drop-down menu that allows you to choose which operation you would like to apply to the polynomials. Once you have entered the two polynomials and the operation you would like to conduct, simply hit the compute button above the drop-down menu. To the right of the text boxes, you will find the answer that the program has calculated. 

## Graphing Polynomials:
	Towards the bottom of the screen, you will find a button that is labelled “Graph Polynomial”. To graph a polynomial, enter the polynomial which you would like to graph in the textbox where it says “Enter your First Polynomial”. Then click the “Graph Polynomial” button. After you have clicked this button, the graph should appear in the graphing window. You may repeat this process for as many polynomials as you would like. 

## Finding the Roots
	To find the roots of a Polynomial, simply enter the polynomial in the text box below the description “Enter a polynomial here to find the roots”. Once you have entered the polynomial into the textbox, click the “find roots” button and the roots should appear in the lower right corner of the main screen. 

## Finding the Derivative
	To find the derivative of the polynomial, drag the circle icon on the derivative slider bar to see all the derivatives of the polynomial.
